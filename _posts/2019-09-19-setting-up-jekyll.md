# Intent

I really want to build out a dynamic application-like interface like gitbook and etc.
However in terms of time I decided to opt to working on a fast static site for my blog.
I can alway tinker and play around with the content, add javascript/elm later.

Styles are a pain in Github Pages... I'm working out the kinks of the blog but I have a style-less html page up.
