# Introductions

Hello I am Leonardo Lee, I am currently a developer at Expedia Group.
I work in the Partner Services division of Expedia providing tools for partners to manage their properties.

This is a small stint of a blog to help keep me accountable while I set up a Ghost managed blog.
I plan on doing some cool things with it and set it up so that I have a Google Application running the thing from behind the scenes.
